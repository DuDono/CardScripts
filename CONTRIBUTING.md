Please direct all bug reports and questions to Discord. Do **NOT** open issues or pull requests for these purposes.

## Bug Fixes

- The title should be a concise description of the fix, including the name of the card, and ideally an action in the present tense.
- Provide a detailed description of the bug that is fixed in the pull request.
- Include `Closes #xxx` if the pull request resolves a specific issue.
- Attach a replay or puzzle that demonstrates the incorrect interaction. Including references to correct rulings is highly encouraged.

## New Additions to the Script Project

- **Overriding existing EDOPro scripts**:  
  Scripts designed to override existing EDOPro scripts should be placed in the appropriate folder corresponding to the type of the overridden script (e.g., `anime`, `goat`, `official`).  

- **Scripts for new custom cards**:  
  Scripts for newly added custom cards must be placed in a folder named after the contributor (formatted as `contributor's name_contributor's number`). This number is assigned when the contributor is approved, following the guidelines provided in [VaultCDB](https://github.com/YGOProjectUnderground/VaultCDB.git).
